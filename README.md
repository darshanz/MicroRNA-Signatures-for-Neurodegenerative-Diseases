This repository contains code and analysis for identifying mRNA signatures 
associated with various neurodegenerative diseases using publicly available
 gene expression datasets. 



 ### Dataset
    The dataset used in this study is sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) download [GEO Accession viewer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE120584).

    The dataset contains 1601 samples for various neurodegenerative diseases as shown in the table below (01B_Data_Exploration.ipynb):


| Disease Case | Sample Size |
|--------------|-------------|
| Alzheimer’s disease (AD) | 1,021 |
| Vascular dementia (VaD) | 91 |
| Dementia with lewy bodies (DLB) | 169 |
| Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) | 32 |
| Normal control (NC) | 288 |
